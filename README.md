=============

This simple platformer game was developed for users with a physical handicap such as missing lower arm(s) or hand(s) and users with severe motor impairments. Naturally it can also be played by people without any of these handicaps. This game was part of a 72 hour-long 'Accessibility Games' Gamejam.
